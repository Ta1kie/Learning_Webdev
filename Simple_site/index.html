        <h1>My Journey of becoming a Developer</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Radovan and this is my first project, a bare-bone website in HTML as I start my journey of transition of my career from QA to Developer!</p>
        <h2>But Rado, you are a QA, why do you want to learn how to code?</h2>
            <p>Glad you asked, I can provide a few simple answers for this questions, and they are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To be able not just to test but also to create the code and some insteresting stuff!</li>
                <li>Leaning new technologies</li>
                <li>Finding a better job</li>
                <li>Meeting new people</li>
                <li>Be able to build something by myself</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Where can I learn how to code too?</h2>
            <p>I am learning how to code via Back-End Developer career path on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a></p>
        <div id="aboutme">
            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>As I meantioned in the beggining I am Radovan, I am currently employed as a <strong>Senior Tester</strong>, working on banking apps which are written in <strong><em>JavaScript-Angular</em></strong>.
                Unfortunately I am a manual tester, so I am unable to ensure a smooth automatization of test processes. So to ensure healthy career progression I am learning how to code so I will be able to find a more qualified job.</p>
        <h2>My very first lines of HTML!</h2>
            <p>This site works as a proof that those are my very first 33 lines of code without any documentation or help. <strong>Pretty cool right</strong>?</strong></p>
